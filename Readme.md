International Portfolio Analysis

Introduction
The main goal of this project is to create and evaluate a unique and diversified portfolio for investment, considering the same weight for each asset, including both brazillian and american Stocks/REITs, and compare to 3 differents benchmarks, looking the Risk-Return value of each portfolio:

- S&P 500
- DJI
- IBOVESPA
The comparison is made using the Return and the Risk of each of these index and the Diversified Portfolio. The Risk of the diversified portfolio is calculated using the Modern Portfolio Theory, created by Harry Markowitz. The risk of each benchmark is assumed as the standard deviation of the returns. The Risk-Return of the portfolio and the indexes are obtained using the Sharp Ratio concept.

Markowitz’s assumptions are:

- Investors are rational (risk-averse) and will always behave in a certain manner, maximizing return and minimizing the risk;
- Investors will accept increased risk only if compensated with higher expected returns;
- Investors receive all pertinent information regarding their investment decision in a timely manner.
- Investors can borrow or lend an unlimited amount of capital at a risk-free rate of interest.

This resolution is guided by CRISP-DM method, which has the step-by-step process to solve this problem. This method has 6    phases, each of these phases are detailed in the topics bellow.

- Business understanding – What does the business need?
- Data understanding – What data do we have / need? Is it clean?
- Data preparation – How do we organize the data for modeling?
- Modeling – What modeling techniques should we apply?
- Evaluation – Which model best meets the business objectives?
- Deployment – How do stakeholders access the results?

This study will comprehend the steps from 1 to 5, using the Modern Theory showed before.

Ps.: these portfolios are not a recommendation for any investment, they are used only for study purpose.
